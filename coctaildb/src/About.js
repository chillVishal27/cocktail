        The Oxford Dictionaries define cocktail as "An alcoholic drink
        consisting of a spirit or spirits mixed with other ingredients, such as
        fruit juice or cream". A cocktail can contain alcohol, a sugar, and
        a bitter/citrus. When a mixed drink contains only a distilled spirit and
        a mixer, such as soda or fruit juice, it is a highball. Many of the
        International Bartenders Association Official Cocktails are highballs.
        When a mixed drink contains only a distilled spirit and a liqueur, it is
        a duo, and when it adds a mixer, it is a trio. Additional ingredients
        may be sugar, honey, milk, cream, and various herbs. Mixed drinks
        without alcohol that resemble cocktails are known as "mocktails" or
        "virgin cocktails".
